todos should have crud functionality using different pages to create and edit and see one and see all todos, also associate the todos with the current user and add authentication middleware to protect the todos routes, only display todos for current user, only allow crud for user that owns the todos, also add pagination to todos, add search bar and filters, you do not need to do everything in one shot if you cannot do it, do it step by step, ask me questions if you need any information, add validation to todos
